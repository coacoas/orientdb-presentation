		<h3>Multi-Model on the Orient(DB) Express</h3>
		<p>
			<a href="http://orientdb.com">OrientDB</a> is a hybrid NoSQL database with elements of Document and Graph databases. It provides linear scalability and impressive performance capabilities through its zero-configuration multi-master architecture (backed by Hazelcast).

			OrientDB is written in Java, so it can be installed anywhere a JVM can be loaded, with bindings for many languages and a REST API. 
			
			And it does all this while still providing full ACID compliance.
