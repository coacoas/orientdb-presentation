# orientdb-presentation
Presentation and supporting code/configuration for my introduction to OrientDB

Presentation available at https://coacoas.github.io/orientdb-presentation

Docker configuration is available in orientdb-docker.  Includes the Dockerfile I used, as well as fig.yml and config files used for launching the containers.  I did not include the databases as they can be built from ETL scritps (also added in the config/etl folder) or downloaded from the web (VehicleHistoryGraph).  
 
The server runs dserver.sh by default. 

THe (admittedly tiny) demo drivers are loaded in the demo/ package.
